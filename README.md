# Macro-Economic Resilience & Structural Shocks: A Leontief Analysis of Hungary (2008–2009)

## Project Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive macroeconomic structural analysis of the Hungarian economy during the pivotal transition years of the **Global Financial Crisis (2008–2009)**. Utilizing the **Leontief Input-Output (I-O) framework**, this study quantifies inter-industry dependencies and sectoral output multipliers across 40+ industrial nodes.

The goal of this project was to move beyond static data observation to measure the "Inter-locked" nature of an economy and identify how global demand shocks propagate through domestic supply chains.

## Technical Methodology
The analysis follows a three-stage prescriptive and longitudinal approach using matrix algebra in Excel:

1.  **Technical Coefficient Matrix (A):** Normalizing intermediate consumption to establish direct requirements per unit of output.
2.  **Structural Matrix Logic:** Computing $(I - A)$ to determine the relationship between internal production and final demand.
3.  **Leontief Inverse Calculation:** Solving for $(I - A)^{-1}$ to derive **Total Output Multipliers**, capturing both direct and indirect economic effects.



## Strategic Insights & Key Findings
* **Systemic Multiplier Contraction:** The analysis revealed a significant decline in output multipliers across nearly all sectors between 2008 and 2009, signaling a weakening of inter-industry linkages during the credit crunch.
* **Manufacturing as the Economic Anchor:** Despite the recession, the **Secondary (Manufacturing) sector** consistently exhibited the highest backward linkages. Specifically, *Motor Vehicle Production (C29)* and *Electronics (C26)* served as the primary "pull" engines for the national economy.
* **Tertiary Sector Fragility:** The **Services sector** showed lower multipliers and a higher reliance on final consumption, making it more vulnerable to immediate drops in household spending compared to the more "inter-locked" manufacturing industries.



## Policy & Consulting Implications
The study concludes that for small open economies (SOEs) like Hungary, fiscal stimulus is most effective when targeted at **High-Multiplier Manufacturing hubs**. Because of their deep backward linkages, these sectors act as catalysts, stimulating connected upstream suppliers more effectively than service-oriented spending.
